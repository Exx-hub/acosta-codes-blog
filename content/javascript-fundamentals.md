**JavaScript** powers the web - it's the most important programming language you need to know as a web developer.
It is a lightweight, interpreted programming language designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. **JavaScript** is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.

## Basic JS Snippet

For example, you should understand code like this:

```js
const basics = 'Okay, that should not be too difficult actually';

function printBasics() {
  console.log(basics):
}

printBasics();
```
